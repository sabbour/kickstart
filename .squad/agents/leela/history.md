# Project Context

- **Owner:** Ahmed Sabbour
- **Project:** Imagine — AI-guided onboarding experience for deploying apps to AKS
- **Stack:** HTML/CSS/JS (Portal Prototyper framework), TypeScript, Azure/AKS
- **Created:** 2026-04-08

## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### 2026-04-08: Kickstart Architecture Foundation
- **Rename:** Project is "Imagine" → "Kickstart". Repo will move to sabbour/kickstart.
- **Dual surface:** Web (SWA + Portal Prototyper) and MCP (tools + future App UI). If we host it, we provide the LLM. If MCP, user's LLM.
- **Monorepo:** npm workspaces — `packages/core`, `packages/web`, `packages/mcp-server`.
- **Web stays vanilla JS** — Portal Prototyper is zero-dep, SWA deploys with `skip_app_build: true`. No React unless proven necessary.
- **A2UI pattern adopted, not library** — JSON UI schemas in core, each surface renders natively.
- **Conversation engine:** Hybrid state machine (phase tracking) + LLM (natural language per phase). Phases 1-4 for Phase 1 ship.
- **MCP tools first** in Phase 1: `kickstart`, `generate-manifests`, `check-status`. MCP App UI deferred.
- **IaC:** Bicep for Azure infra, `az` CLI scripts for Entra (Graph Bicep provider is preview, too risky).
- **Branching:** `squad/{issue}-{slug}`. Fry owns web/, Bender owns core/ + mcp-server/ + infra/, Hermes owns tests/.
- **Shared contracts** (`ui-schema.ts`, `types.ts`) are the integration bottleneck — require Lead review.
- **Key files:** `js/config.js` (auth config, needs migration to new tenant), `staticwebapp.config.json` (SWA routing), `infra/` (to be created).
- **Tenant pivot:** Entra app must be recreated in CA Global Demos 2605 tenant (caglobaldemos2605.onmicrosoft.com), not Microsoft corp tenant.
- **Ahmed's model preference:** claude-opus-4.6 for code, claude-haiku-4.5 for non-code.
- **Phase 1 defers:** cost estimation, Mermaid diagrams, K8s validation, MCP App UI, conversation phases 5-8, Codespaces integration.

### 2025-07-25: Docs structure and architecture diagrams
- Created `docs/architecture.md` with 7 Mermaid diagrams: system overview (C4-style), web flow sequence, IDE/MCP flow sequence, 6-phase conversation pipeline, A2UI rendering pipeline, 3-layer prompt architecture, and deployment architecture.
- Created `docs/README.md` as index linking to architecture, contributing, and infra docs.
- Created root `README.md` with project description, dual-surface concept, quick start, tech stack table, and links to docs.
- A2UI catalog has 17 components (7 standard, 6 Kickstart, 4 GitHub). Catalog schema uses JSON Schema draft/2020-12.
- 6-phase engine confirmed: Discover→Design→Generate→Review→Handoff→Deploy. K8s hidden in phases 1-3, visible in 4-6.
- Deployment safeguards DS001–DS013 enforced across all phases via Layer 2 system prompt.

### 2025-07-25: Spark-like UX Evolution Scoping
- **Key insight:** Kickstart ≠ Spark. Spark generates full runnable apps; Kickstart generates infrastructure (Bicep, Dockerfiles, Helm, GH Actions) and deploys to AKS. "Preview" = architecture diagram + deployment plan, not a running app.
- **Landing page** already Spark-like (carousel, track cards, framework pills, IDE links). Gap: needs a hero text input above everything — single biggest UX win.
- **Split-view layout** (chat left, file-viewer right) already exists in `core.css`. File viewer is `<aside class="file-viewer">` toggled by `files:generated` EventBus event.
- **File generation display** only in sidebar today. P0: add in-chat file chips with progressive status.
- **No code view toggle** exists. P1: add Preview|Code toggle in right panel header.
- **No deploy button.** P1: add Deploy CTA in topbar, maps to Spark's "Publish" but targets AKS.
- **Spark tabs** (Iterate/Theme/Data/Prompts/Assets): Theme irrelevant (infra not UI). Prompts already exists as debug toggle. Assets (upload Dockerfiles/manifests) is P2.
- **P0 is ~11 hours, all vanilla JS.** Hero input, file chips, sparkle loading, preview rename. No framework change needed.
- **Key files touched:** `index.html` (hero input), `landing.css` (input styles), `components.css` (file chips, sparkle), `app.js` (hero handler, file chip rendering), `components.js` (new factories).
- **Ahmed preference:** claude-opus-4.6 for code, claude-haiku-4.5 for non-code (confirmed still active).

### 2025-07-26: Smart Control Pack Patterns — Deep Dive into adaptive-ui-framework
- **Source repos analyzed:** `sabbour/adaptive-ui-framework` (core + pack system), `sabbour/adaptive-ui-azure-pack`, `sabbour/adaptive-ui-github-pack`, `sabbour/adaptive-ui-try-aks` (app).
- **14 patterns catalogued:** Pack Registration (P01), Self-Managing Login (P02), Data-Fetching Picker (P03), Write-with-Confirm (P04), LLM Inference-Time Tools (P05), Knowledge Skills Resolver (P06), Disabled Context (P07), State-as-Token (P08), CORS Proxy (P09), Artifact-Aware Components (P10), Auto-Continue (P11), ARM Introspection (P12), Client-Side Validation + Auto-Fix (P13), Intent Resolvers (P14).
- **Azure Pack:** 4 components (azureLogin, azureResourceForm, azurePicker, azureQuery), 2 tools (azure_arm_get, azure_pricing), skills resolver (ARM templates + AKS Automatic knowledge), MSAL auth, 27 diagram icons.
- **GitHub Pack:** 6 components (githubLogin, githubPicker, githubQuery, githubRepoInfo, githubCreatePR, githubSetSecret), 1 tool (github_api_get), OAuth Device Flow + PAT auth.
- **App Layer:** ArchitectureDiagram (Mermaid+ELK+icons+pan/zoom), CostEstimate, CompactCodeBlock, DevEnvironmentCard, K8sValidator (13 rules + auto-fix), SafeguardsChecker, DiagramBuilder.
- **Key architecture insight:** The old framework's power comes from 3 layers A2UI doesn't have: (1) ServicePack bundling (components + prompts + tools + auth), (2) ServiceConnector (auth token management separate from UI state), (3) orchestration middleware (skills resolvers, tool executors, artifact store). All 3 must be built in Kickstart's app layer.
- **A2UI mapping:** All pack components → fat A2UI custom components via `createReactComponent()`. Auth → ServiceConnector (React Context). Tools → Kickstart orchestration layer. Skills → phase engine middleware. Artifacts → Kickstart core store.
- **8 gaps identified:** No pack system (G01), no service layer (G02), no tool system (G03), no prompt injection (G04), no artifact store (G05), no past-turn isolation (G06), no auto-continue (G07), no state interpolation (G08, but JSON Pointers cover it).
- **Migration estimate:** ~16.5 developer-days for full pack port. P0 = auth connectors + CORS proxy (3.5 days). P1 = core pickers, loginCards, GitHub commit, validator (5.5 days). P2 = ARM forms, diagrams, write actions (6 days). P3 = tool ports, diagram builder, intent resolvers (2.5 days).
- **Full decision:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/leela-pack-architecture.md`

### 2026-04-08: Spark-like UX Roadmap — P0/P1/P2 Prioritization

- **Full decision:** Documented in `.squad/decisions/inbox/leela-spark-ux-roadmap.md` (merged into decisions.md). Complete gap analysis + prioritized roadmap.
- **P0 scope (~11 hours, ship next sprint):** (1) Hero text input above carousel, (2) In-chat file chips with status, (3) Sparkle/pulse loading animation, (4) Right panel as "Preview" (contextual titles, A2UI diagram support).
- **P1 scope (~26 hours, one sprint after P0):** (5) Code view toggle (Preview|Code modes), (6) Deploy CTA button (top bar, AKS target dialog), (7) Session persistence + Recent/Favorites.
- **P2 scope (backlog):** (8) Selective workspace tabs (Iterate, Files, Prompts, Assets — not Theme), (9) "Open Codespace" / "Create Repository" menu, (10) Mermaid diagram rendering in preview.
- **Vanilla JS all the way:** No framework change needed. Component factory pattern in `components.js` handles all P0/P1 work.
- **Event bus extensions:** `files:generating`, `files:generated`, `preview:show`, `deploy:ready`, `deploy:started`, `deploy:progress`, `deploy:complete`.
- **Key distinction:** Spark publishes running apps. Kickstart generates infrastructure (Bicep, Dockerfiles, Helm, GH Actions) and deploys to AKS. Preview = architecture diagram + deployment plan + IaC files, not a running app. UX must reflect this.
- **Next:** Fry assigned P0 in background mode. P1 is one sprint after P0 ships. P2 depends on GitHub OAuth and MCP App UI (deferred features).

### 2025-07-25: Rendering Architecture Decision — Kill the Regex
- **Root cause confirmed:** `response-processor.ts` regex `A2UI_FENCE_RE` requires closing `~~~` at exact string end. Any trailing LLM content = silent extraction failure. Components vanish, raw JSON shows as chat text.
- **Heuristic fallback only covers 2/6 phases** (discover, design). Generate/Review/Handoff/Deploy get zero components on regex failure — exactly the phases where components matter most.
- **adaptive-ui comparison:** adaptive-ui uses NO regex. Entire LLM response is a JSON `AdaptiveUISpec`. Renderer consumes directly. That's why Ahmed got better results — the framework makes failure impossible.
- **Decision: Option C — Structured JSON Envelope.** 3-phase migration:
  - Phase 1 (1-2 days): Fix regex + expand heuristics to all 6 phases. Ship immediately.
  - Phase 2 (1-2 weeks): Switch to `response_format: json_object`. LLM outputs `{ message, components, stateUpdates }`. Incremental JSON streaming for text. Eliminates regex entirely. Adds state management.
  - Phase 3 (1 week): Component streaming (components appear one-by-one like Spark files). State binding (`{{state.runtime}}`). Auto-continue for phase transitions.
- **a2ui-renderer.js is PRESERVED.** All 17 component renderers unchanged. Only the extraction layer changes (regex → JSON parse).
- **A2UI vs adaptive-ui verdict:** A2UI architecture was the right choice (MCP integration, multi-surface, catalog model). Implementation was wrong (fenced blocks in markdown). Fix = adopt adaptive-ui's structured JSON pattern into A2UI's component model. Best of both.
- **Key pipeline files:** `response-processor.ts` (extraction), `converse.ts` (streaming SSE), `api-client.js` (client stream reader), `engine.js` (state machine), `a2ui-renderer.js` (DOM rendering), `system-prompt.ts` (LLM instructions), `phases.ts` (phase prompts with ~~~a2ui examples).
- **Full decision:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/leela-rendering-architecture.md`
- **SUPERSEDED:** This decision was obsoleted by `leela-pragmatic-a2ui-react.md` after discovery that A2UI React renderer already exists.

### 2026-04-08: Pragmatic A2UI v0.9 React Adoption — The Shortest Path
- **Discovery:** `@a2ui/react` v0.9 renderer ALREADY EXISTS at `renderers/react/src/v0_9/`. Apache 2.0 licensed, production-ready, 18 basic components implemented.
- **Architecture:** Two-context React pattern with `A2uiSurface`, `createReactComponent()` factory, `GenericBinder` + `useSyncExternalStore`, `DeferredChild` for lazy loading, `SurfaceModel` from `@a2ui/web_core/v0_9` for component buffer + data model.
- **adaptive-ui-try-aks pattern:** React/Vite/TypeScript, outputs structured JSON (not fenced blocks), renders via React engine. This is the proven path — same team, same tech stack.
- **Decision:** Adopt `@a2ui/react` v0.9 directly. Migrate frontend to React/Vite. Kill the regex. Output structured JSON from LLM.
- **Alignment strategy:** Use the code that exists today (Apache 2.0). When v0.9 ships officially, update the dependency. If release stalls, vendor it. Either way, we're not blocked.
- **Frontend migration:** Vanilla JS → React/Vite (~1 week, Fry's domain). Portal Prototyper CSS preserved (it's just CSS classes). Vite = instant dev server, HMR, TypeScript out-of-box.
- **Structured JSON envelope:** LLM outputs `{ message, a2ui_messages }`. Backend parses JSON, forwards A2UI messages via SSE. Client calls `processMessages()`. Regex eliminated.
- **Free from `@a2ui/react`:** 18 basic components, surface model, data binding via JSON Pointers, component registry, theme system, two-context optimization, DeferredChild, action handling.
- **Kickstart custom components:** CostEstimate, ArchitectureDiagram, FileEditor, AuthCard, WorkflowStatus, RepoPicker, CodespaceLink, AppOverview — all registered via `createReactComponent()`.
- **4-phase migration:** (1) React/Vite + A2UI integration + kill regex (1 week), (2) Custom Kickstart catalog (1-2 weeks), (3) Port try-aks features — diagrams, K8s validation, auth, Cloud Shell (2-3 weeks), (4) Data binding, multi-surface, component streaming (1-2 weeks).
- **Supersedes:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/leela-rendering-architecture.md` (Option C). Previous decision assumed vanilla JS rendering + JSON extraction. Now we're adopting React renderer entirely.
- **Full decision:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/leela-pragmatic-a2ui-react.md`

### 2026-04-08: Two-Repo Strategy — sabbour/a2ui Fork + sabbour/kickstart App
- **Pattern:** Mirrors adaptive-ui-framework + adaptive-ui-try-aks split. Framework extensions in fork, app-specific code in Kickstart.

### 2026-04-09: Consolidated Backlog Audit — Single Source of Truth
- **Finding:** Three disconnected tracking systems (SQL todos, decisions.md R-items, untracked Playground work) caused duplication + gaps. No single source of truth.
- **Audit:** Consolidated 45 items across 5 sources (SQL, R01–R09 + G01–G08 + G1–G6 from decisions, Playground work, untracked infrastructure). Created 105 B-items (B-01 through B-103).
- **Cross-reference table:** Every old ID (p1–p4, R1–R9, G01–G08, G1–G6) mapped to new B-item or marked superseded. Two items (leela-rendering-architecture, leela-spark-ux-roadmap) archived as decision obsoletes.
- **Key blockers identified:** Action loop (B-23–B-25) is hard blocker. Components fire events but have no handler. Blocks all P1 work. Recommend P0 = 9 days.
- **Effort reality:** 68 days for P0+P1+P2+Ops (45 items) assumes clear specs. P1 has unknowns (fat components, token mgmt, artifact store API). Recommend: Timebox B-10 (ServicePack design) as 2-day spike, run B-12 (Azure components) as proof-of-concept early.
- **Critical unknowns:** OpenAI function calling stability, MSAL token refresh in SSE, A2UI v0.9 component streaming capability, GitHub OAuth timeout UX. Recommend: Early spikes before commitments.
- **Deferred-but-important:** MCP tools (undefined scope, Phase 1 pivot unclear), multi-surface rendering (P3), cost estimation (scope ambiguous — spike recommended).
- **Output:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/leela-consolidated-backlog.md` — 20KB canonical backlog with cross-references, superseded items table, effort summary, owner assignments, critical path, and recommendations.
- **sabbour/a2ui (fork):** Generic catalog components (Table, Chart, Stepper), renderer improvements (streaming, SSR), data binding utilities, schema tooling, upstream contributions. Zero Kickstart/Azure/AKS logic.
- **sabbour/kickstart (app):** All Kickstart-specific components (CostEstimate, ArchitectureDiagram, FileEditor, AuthCard, WorkflowStatus, etc.), chat UI, LLM integration, phase engine, MCP server, Azure/GitHub APIs.
- **Consumption:** npm workspace + side-by-side checkout. Dev: `npm link @a2ui/react` for instant changes. CI: `file:` dependency OR published GitHub Package (future).
- **Boundary rule:** If ANY A2UI app could use it → fork. If it knows AKS/Azure/GitHub/Kickstart → app. When unsure → start in app, promote when reuse proven.
- **Upstream path:** Develop in fork, test in Kickstart, PR to google/A2UI when stable. Bug fixes always upstream.
- **Developer setup:** Clone both repos side-by-side, `npm link` in fork, link in Kickstart. README documents this.
- **Why NOT submodules:** Pain. Why NOT GitHub Packages now: Overkill for prototype. Why NOT vendoring: Drift risk.
- **Full decision:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/leela-two-repo-strategy.md`

### 2025-07-25: Trip Notebook Smart Control Patterns Research
- **Repo analyzed:** `sabbour/adaptive-ui-trip-notebook` — AI travel planning assistant with 3 packs, 11 smart controls, 7 tools.
- **Three packs:** `@sabbour/adaptive-ui-travel-data-pack` (weather, country info, currency, checklists, budget), `@sabbour/adaptive-ui-google-maps-pack` (maps, places search, nearby, photo cards), `@sabbour/adaptive-ui-google-flights-pack` (flight search, flight cards with protobuf URL encoding).
- **Key pattern: Component-Autonomous Fetching** — Components like weatherCard/countryInfoCard call APIs themselves at render time. LLM provides minimal props (city name), component handles loading/error/display. Saves tokens, enables real-time data.
- **Key pattern: Dual-Entry API** — Every external API has BOTH a tool (LLM calls for reasoning) AND a component (visual, client-side fetch). System prompt instructs when to use each. Optimizes token usage.
- **Key pattern: Artifact Extraction Pipeline** — App walks AdaptiveUISpec layout tree after each LLM response, extracts structured data (places, flights, budget items, itinerary days, photos) into typed artifacts. Enables second-panel aggregation.
- **Key pattern: Cross-Component State Binding** — `bind` prop + `{{state.key}}` interpolation enables implicit communication. Selecting a hotel auto-updates restaurant search location. Eliminates need for LLM-orchestrated multi-step updates.
- **Key pattern: Graceful Degradation Chain** — FlightSearch: live results → link-only → error banner. Three tiers. Every component that calls external APIs needs this.
- **Key pattern: Artifact-Driven Side Panel** — TripNotebook subscribes to artifact store, categorizes by filename prefix convention (flight-*, budget-*, itinerary-day-*), renders in tabbed interface. Decouples data production from consumption.
- **Key pattern: Protobuf URL Construction** — Custom minimal protobuf encoder for Google Flights deep links. Pattern for services with binary/encoded URL parameters.
- **Key pattern: HTML Scraping as API** — Flights pack parses Google Flights HTML via CORS proxy when no official API exists. Fallback pattern for APIs that don't have official endpoints.
- **Kickstart implications:** (1) Components should fetch their own data for real-time display (e.g., AKS cluster status polling), (2) Every Azure/GitHub API needs both tool + component entry points, (3) Artifact prefix convention enables dashboard panel aggregation, (4) State binding enables cross-phase data flow in 6-phase conversation, (5) All external API components need 4-tier degradation (rich → cached → link → error).
- **Recommended Kickstart packs:** azure-pack (cluster status, cost, deployment), github-pack (repo, workflow, PR), iac-pack (file editor, manifest preview, architecture diagram), auth-pack (Entra app, RBAC, secrets).
- **Full decision:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/leela-trip-notebook-patterns.md`

### 2026-04-09: Pack Research Synthesis — Architecture Foundation Approved
- **Two research initiatives completed:** (1) adaptive-ui-try-aks pack inventory (14 patterns, 9 A2UI recommendations), (2) adaptive-ui-trip-notebook pattern analysis (7 new patterns, 4 Kickstart packs).
- **14 pack patterns consolidated:** P01 (Pack Registration), P02 (Self-Managing Login), P03 (Data-Fetching Picker), P04 (Write-with-Confirm), P05 (LLM Inference-Time Tools), P06 (Knowledge Skills Resolver), P07 (Disabled Context), P08 (State-as-Token), P09 (CORS Proxy), P10 (Artifact-Aware Components), P11 (Auto-Continue), P12 (ARM Introspection), P13 (Client-Side Validation + Auto-Fix), P14 (Intent Resolvers).
- **8 A2UI gaps mapped:** No pack system → ServicePack abstraction (R01). No service layer → ServiceConnector pattern (R02). No tools → orchestration layer (R04). No skills resolver → phase engine middleware (R05). No artifact store → Kickstart core (R07). No validation → pure TS port (R08). Others have A2UI native solutions.
- **ServicePack + ServiceConnector pattern adopted:** All pack components become fat A2UI custom components. Auth/tools/skills/artifacts stay in Kickstart orchestration. This preserves adaptive-ui's rich capabilities (components + tools + state binding) while building on A2UI's renderer and component model.
- **Migration priority table finalized:** P0 (auth connectors, CORS proxy) = 3.5 days. P1 (pickers, logins, GitHub commit, validator) = 5.5 days. P2 (ARM forms, diagrams, write actions) = 6 days. P3 (tool ports, builders, resolvers) = 2.5 days. Total ~16.5 days.
- **7 trip notebook patterns codified:** A (Component-Autonomous Fetching), B (Artifact Extraction), C (Dual-Entry API), D (State Binding), E (Graceful Degradation), F (Artifact-Driven Panel), G (Protobuf URLs), H (HTML Scraping), I (Pack Scoping), J (Session-Scoped Artifacts).
- **Architecture ready for buildout:** Foundation stone is ServiceConnector (auth token management outside UI state). Once connectors exist, fat components can register and orchestrator can wire tools. All subsequent packs follow same pattern.
- **Decisions merged:** leela-pack-architecture.md + leela-trip-notebook-patterns.md appended to `.squad/decisions.md`.

### 2025-07-26: A2UI Actions System Analysis — Gap Analysis & Implementation Path
- **A2UI v0.9 action model:** Two-tier system — Events (agent-side, carry name/surfaceId/context with resolved JSON Pointer values) and Functions (local renderer-only, openUrl + validation + math/string ops). Data Model Sync sends full UI state with every message. Write contract guarantees synchronous local updates. Sandboxed execution prevents arbitrary code injection.
- **Critical finding — ACTION DEAD-END:** `useA2UI.ts` wires the MessageProcessor action handler to `console.log` only. A2UI events fire correctly through the full vendor pipeline (ComponentContext → SurfaceModel → SurfaceGroupModel → MessageProcessor) but produce zero effect. Every interactive component is decorative.
- **No action endpoint:** Backend `converse.ts` only accepts chat messages (`{ sessionId, message }`). No way to receive structured A2UI action events.
- **Hybrid action mismatch:** `response-processor.ts` generates buttons with non-standard `action: "reply"` format that bypasses A2UI ActionSchema entirely. Two incompatible action systems coexist.
- **6 major gaps identified:** G1 (action dead-end), G2 (no action endpoint), G3 (hybrid action mismatch), G4 (no tool system), G5 (no service layer), G6 (no pack system).
- **Key architectural insight:** A2UI's `action.event` system IS the ServicePack action bus. Event name = action type, context = payload, action handler = router to pack logic. This is structurally identical to adaptive-ui-framework's `handleAction` switch but using A2UI native plumbing.
- **5-phase implementation path:** (1) Wire action loop + backend endpoint (2-3 days), (2) Tool system with tool-call loop (3-4 days), (3) ServiceConnector + auth (3-4 days), (4) Pack system (2-3 days), (5) Rich interactions — artifacts, auto-continue, disabled context (2-3 days). Total ~12-17 days.
- **Phase 1 is critical path.** Everything builds on a working action loop. Without it, no ServicePack, no tools, no auth can function.
- **adaptive-ui-framework action types mapped:** sendPrompt → event with prompt in context, setState → local data model update, navigate → openUrl function, submit → event with serialized state, custom → pack-specific event handler.
- **Full decision:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/leela-a2ui-actions-analysis.md`

### 2026-04-09: Naming Proposal Approved — APIConnector + IntegrationKit

- **Proposed:** APIClient + IntegrationKit for ServiceConnector (B-11) and ServicePack (B-10).
- **User override:** APIClient → APIConnector (better emphasizes connection/auth management).
- **Final decision documented:** Both names follow established patterns (HttpClient, Firebase Kit conventions). Ready for implementation.
- **Cross-team alignment:** Bender and Fry briefed. Will refactor codebase in B-11/B-10 PRs.
- **Backlog consolidated:** Merged all scattered SQL todos, R-items, G-items, and untracked work into single-source-of-truth backlog (leela-consolidated-backlog.md). 45 total items, 68-day estimate, P0–P3 + Ops prioritized. Critical path: B-23–B-25 (action loop) 9 days.

### 2025-07-26: IntegrationKit Abstraction (B-10)

- **Name:** `IntegrationKit` (renamed from ServicePack per user directive). Lives in `packages/core/src/kits/`.
- **Interface:** `{ name, description, tools: Tool<any>[], connectors: APIConnector[], prompts?: string[], components?: ComponentRegistration[] }`. `components` is frontend-only — core records type identifiers, web binds React components.
- **Registry pattern:** `IntegrationKitRegistry` mirrors `ToolRegistry` / `APIConnectorRegistry`. `registerKit(kit)` is the public API; delegates to `defaultKitRegistry`. On register, auto-wires tools → `ToolRegistry`, connectors → `APIConnectorRegistry`.
- **Typed constraint:** `tools: Tool<any>[]` required (not `Tool[]`) because individual tool files type their args as specific interfaces, not `Record<string, unknown>`. The `Tool<any>` escape hatch matches `ToolRegistry`'s existing pattern.
- **AzureKit:** azure_resource_list + azure_resource_get + estimate_cost tools; AzureARMConnector + PricingConnector; 4 system-prompt augmentations (AKS Automatic preference, resource discovery, cost transparency, K8s abstraction); azureLoginCard + azureResourcePicker component registrations.
- **GitHubKit:** github_repo_info tool; GitHubConnector; 3 system-prompt augmentations (repo-first detection, CI/CD OIDC wiring, branch strategy); githubLoginCard + githubRepoPicker component registrations.
- **App startup wiring:** `registerKit(azureKit); registerKit(githubKit)` called in `packages/web/src/main.tsx` before ReactDOM render. Kits push into `defaultRegistry` (tools) and `defaultConnectorRegistry` (connectors) — both singletons available to engine + MCP.
- **Tests:** 23 contract tests in `integration-kit.test.ts`, all green alongside existing 286 tests (309 total).
- **Commit:** `c7b99ac` on main.

## [ARCHIVE SUMMARY] Pre-2026-04-09 Architecture & Decisions

The learnings in this file through 2026-04-09 capture foundational architecture (monorepo, toolchain, auth setup, backlog consolidation). When file size exceeds 50KB, consider archiving older entries (pre-April 2026) to `history-archive.md` while keeping recent named-decision entries (B-10/B-11 naming, consolidated backlog, etc.).

Core decisions preserved in `.squad/decisions.md` supersede archived entries. This history is Leela's decision ledger; archive only when approaching 75KB to preserve recent context.

## 2026-04-09T22:32Z — P0–P2 Wave Complete Handoff

**Items owned:** B-10 (1 core item) + code review + architecture direction for all 29 items across P0–P2

**Key contributions:**
- **B-10 IntegrationKit abstraction:** Unified interface for cloud platforms. Two implementations: AzureKit (MSAL auth, ARM tools, Azure pricing, skill resolver) + GitHubKit (Device Flow auth, GitHub tools, repo browsing). Decouples chat engine from platform-specific logic. 309 tests passing.

**Decision leadership:** Merged 6 architectural decisions to canonical registry.
- B-25 handleAction (Bender): unified action model
- B-11 API routing (Bender): api: convention
- B-17 artifact singleton (Bender): pattern
- B-16 CORS proxy (Bender): auth policies
- B-15 phasePrompts (Bender): skill resolver
- B-10 IntegrationKit (Leela): abstraction layer

**Code review notes:** All P0–P2 branches reviewed for:
- Architectural coherence (decisions matched code)
- Test coverage (all PRs require 85%+ coverage)
- No regressions (423 tests baseline maintained)
- Documentation (decisions recorded, history updated)

**Pattern learnings:**
- IntegrationKit as contract enables clean multi-platform support. Prevents monolithic chat engine.
- Decision-driven code reviews: Refer to canonical registry when evaluating PRs.
- Three-phase plan (P0 architecture, P1 features, P2 polish) proved effective for parallel work.

**Team performance:** 29 items shipped with zero regressions. Handoff ready for QA.

**Next P3 priority:** Advanced auth (service principal, ADFS, Enterprise GitHub), offline mode (local code generation), analytics/telemetry, internationalization (i18n).

**Closing notes:** System is stable on main. All decisions recorded. Ready for production deployment decision. Consider P3 scope: either expand platform support (Oracle Cloud, AWS) or deepen AKS Automatic guidance (Workload Identity, gateway API setup, cost optimization).

### B-97 — Docs site update (2025-01)

- Audited docs/ and docs-site/ against the actual codebase before writing — always read source files first.
- Architecture has diverged significantly from early docs: IntegrationKit+APIConnector pattern, ToolRegistry (7 tools), ValidationEngine (7 validators), ArtifactStore, Skill Resolver, and React 19 + Vite 6 frontend.
- Kickstart catalog has 16 custom components (not the 4 or 17 in older docs): RadioGroup, FormGroup, CodeBlock, ProgressSteps, Markdown + 4 GitHub + 3 Azure + 4 deployment components.
- API surface grew from 1 endpoint (/api/chat) to 7: converse, action, generate, health, arm-proxy, github-proxy, pricing-proxy.
- Created docs/development.md (new) with npm run dev, npx vitest run, npx playwright test, and build commands.
- Updated both docs/ (authoritative) and docs-site/ (Docusaurus) in the same commit.

### 2025-07-27: PR + Tagged Release Workflow
- **Branch protection enabled:** Main branch requires PRs. 0 approvers (agents are the team), admins not exempt. No direct pushes.
- **SWA deploy now tag-gated:** `deploy-swa.yml` triggers on `push: tags: ['v*']` instead of `push: branches: [main]`. PR preview environments preserved via `pull_request` trigger.
- **CI is PR-only:** `ci.yml` removed `push: branches: [main]` trigger — runs only on PRs. Added TypeScript check step (`npx tsc --noEmit`).
- **Release flow:** changeset per PR → `npx changeset version` → `git tag vX.Y.Z` → push tag → auto deploy.
- **Infra + docs deploys unchanged:** Still trigger on push to main (path-scoped). Lower risk, no tag gate needed yet.

### 2025-07-27: Sprint Planning — Release Roadmap v0.2.0–v0.5.0
- **4 milestones created:** v0.2.0 (34pt, 10 issues), v0.3.0 (40pt, 8 issues), v0.4.0 (17pt, 12 issues), v0.5.0 (68pt, 18 issues). Total: 159 story points across 48 issues.
- **All 48 issues assigned to milestones.** No unassigned work remains.
- **v0.2.0 P0 items moved to Ready** on the project board (#22, #23, #24, #53, #59). Items already in-progress (#2, #3, #27, #28, #29) left as-is.
- **Two active PRs:** PR #65 (prompt knowledge batch → #3/#27/#28/#29) and PR #66 (questionnaire → #2) — both mergeable, both v0.2.0 scope.
- **Key dependency chain:** #22→#23→#24 (action handler), #34→#25→#30→#31/#32 (ServiceConnector→ServicePack→fat components).
- **Capacity balance:** v0.2.0 is Bender-heavy (core loop), v0.3.0 is balanced, v0.4.0 is light (prompt batch), v0.5.0 is stretch.
