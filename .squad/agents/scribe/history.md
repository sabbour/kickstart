## Learnings

- **2026-04-09 — Orchestration & decision merge workflow:** Created 3 orchestration logs (B-24 action endpoint, B-13 tool system, Hermes tool tests). Merged 3 inbox decision files to decisions.md: changesets versioning, action session store pattern, tool registry extension. Deleted inbox files after merge. Updated Bender and Hermes histories with task outcomes and learnings. Created summary documents for large histories (Bender 42KB, Fry 80KB) as orientation aids. Pattern: Always timestamp in UTC, format decisions with author/date/status/rationale/impact, cross-reference related tasks and decisions.

## 2026-04-09T20:57Z — Wave 10 P0 Finalization

Merged 6 decision inbox entries into `decisions.md`:
- B-25: handleAction unified action model
- B-11: api: action routing convention
- B-17: defaultArtifactStore singleton pattern
- B-16: CORS proxy authorization policies
- B-15: phasePrompts field on IntegrationKit
- B-10: IntegrationKit abstraction (AzureKit/GitHubKit)

All 9 spawn manifest tasks reported complete and merged to main.
Documented orchestration log and session log summary.
Ready for QA handoff.
