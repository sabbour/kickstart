# Fry — Frontend Dev

## Summary (2026-04-10)

Fry (Frontend Dev) has shipped the web surface for Kickstart. The stack evolved from vanilla Portal Prototyper → npm workspaces with React 19 + Fluent UI v9 + A2UI. Key wins: Web scaffold with Vite build, 6-phase conversation engine, API client + streaming, chat-first 3-column UX, Fluent 2 audit loop (all components), Playground interface with dual Preview|JSON view, syntax highlighting, session ID bridge to backend, and past-turn isolation guards (read-only inactive surfaces).

**Build:** 2852 modules (Vite), 302 KB gzipped, zero TypeScript errors, 57/57 Playwright tests.
**Key Dependencies:** @fluentui/react-components, react-markdown, highlight.js, @a2ui/react.
**Pattern:** All components use `createReactComponent(Api, renderFn)` + `makeStyles` + Fluent tokens exclusively.

## Major Work Cycles (2026-04-08 onwards)

### Web Scaffold & React Migration
- Created `packages/web/` with Vite build, zero hardcoded colors/sizes
- Full Fluent UI v9 migration: 22 components (18 basic + 4 custom), no raw HTML
- Fluent 2 token audit: every component update includes spacing/font/color token validation

### Architectural Patterns
- **Component factory pattern:** `createReactComponent(Api, renderFn)` adapter
- **Session ID bridge:** `backendSessionId` field maps frontend UI ↔ backend conversation UUIDs
- **File viewer:** Tabbed display, syntax highlighting (highlight.js), copy buttons
- **3-column layout:** Sessions sidebar | chat center | file viewer (replaced Portal shell)
- **Landing page:** Carousel (10 ideas), track selection, framework quick-start buttons
- **Streaming UX:** Temporary chat bubbles, error recovery with Retry
- **Playground interface:** Tabbed Preview|JSON, real-time scenario JSON generation

### Bug Fixes (2026-04-09/10)
- React 19 Strict Mode surface double-fire: added `useEffect` cleanup that deletes A2UI surfaces
- Griffel `borderColor` shorthand → longhand border properties (Fluent requirement)
- GalleryCard error boundary: class component wrapper prevents single-card crashes
- Past-turn isolation guards: `pointer-events: none` + `opacity: 0.5` on inactive surfaces
- File path verification: `container-registries.svg` (plural), not `container-registry.svg`

### Learnings Carried Forward
- Playwright is now standard — all feature work must include e2e validation
- `useStreaming + useA2UI` pattern is production-ready, no new infrastructure needed
- Session tracking via refs avoids stale closures — use `createSessionIdRef` for callbacks
- "Clear All" is compound operation — future auth resets need multi-component coordination
- Fluent 2 compliance is ongoing — audit spacing, font, color tokens on every update
- CSS `pointer-events: none` is correct mechanism for read-only UI, not handler nulling
- React error boundaries must be class components, `useErrorHandler` is not sufficient

## Completed Tasks
- B-20: Past-turn isolation guards ✅ (pushed 2026-04-09)
