# Sprint Planning Ceremony — v0.6.1 (E2E Demo Ready)

**Date:** 2026-04-15T10:11:35.848Z
**Facilitator:** Leela (Lead)
**Trigger:** Manual — Ahmed flagged overdue sprint-start ceremony
**Sprint goal:** Burn down all 15 open issues. Ship Kickstart E2E demo with no faking or mocking.

---

## 1. Board Drift — Where Process Broke Down

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **12 of 15 issues had no milestone** | Ralph can't burn down what isn't assigned to a sprint. No velocity tracking possible. |
| **All issues had `go:needs-research` label** | Even in-flight work (#298, #299, #274) was still flagged as needing research. Label is meaningless if never cleared. |
| **No priority labels on 11 of 15 issues** | Only #298, #299, #296, #301 had priority labels. Everyone guessed what was important. |
| **#271 and #269 still open** | PR #297 closes both but wasn't merged. Two issues sitting open that have a ready fix. |
| **No time estimates** | Ceremony requires calibrated estimates. We have none. Accepting this gap for now — estimate by T-shirt size below. |
| **v0.6.0 milestone stale** | Only #46 (multi-week MCP epic) open on it. 2 issues closed. Milestone is functionally dead for this sprint. |

**Fixes applied during this ceremony:**
- ✅ All 13 demo-critical issues → v0.6.1 milestone
- ✅ 2 deferred issues (#272, #277) → v0.7.0 milestone (created)
- ✅ `go:needs-research` cleared on in-flight issues (#298, #299, #274, #296)
- ✅ #46 stays on v0.6.0 (out of sprint scope)

## 2. Burndown — Full Issue Board

### 🔥 BURN NOW — In Flight (do not interrupt)

| # | Issue | Owner | Size | Status | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|------|--------|-------|
| PR #297 | **Leela** approve, **Ahmed** merge | — | Ready to merge | Closes #271 + #269. Merge immediately. |
| #298 | **Fry** | M | Active (main worktree) | Surface ownership + phase bar. Foundational — blocks #275, #265. |
| #299 | **Fry** or **@copilot** | S | Active (main worktree) | Debug panel extraction. Ship alongside #298. |
| #274 | **Bender** (backend) + **Fry** (frontend) | L | Active (worktree) | GitHub OAuth. Unblocked — app exists. Zapp reviews before merge. |

**Directive:** Let these 4 lanes finish. No context switches.

### ⏭️ BURN NEXT — Queue when active lanes land

| # | Issue | Owner | Size | Depends on | Sequence |
|---|-------|-------|------|------------|----------|
| #300 | **Bender** | S | None | Can start immediately — prompt-only fix, no frontend. |
| #296 | **@copilot** (Fry reviews) | S | None | Mechanical sweep of 11 files. Fire-and-forget. |
| #275 | **Bender** (prompt/state) + **Fry** (phase UI) | L | #298 merged | Design for conditional 4→6 phase flow. The wizard skeleton. |
| #265 | **Fry** | M | #298 merged | File manager wiring. Can run parallel with #275. |
| #266 | **Bender** | M | None | Phase-based model routing. Backend-only. Can run parallel with #275. |

### 🔒 BLOCKED — Waiting on dependencies

| # | Issue | Owner | Size | Blocked by | When it unblocks |
|---|-------|-------|------|------------|------------------|
| #301 | **Bender** (MSAL/ARM) + **Fry** (AuthCard/DeployProgress) | XL | #274 (auth patterns) + #275 (phase flow) | After GitHub OAuth patterns are proven. Zapp mandatory review. |
| #273 | **Fry** | L | #300 (prompt depth) | After #300 lands. ELK engine swap benefits from richer diagram input. |

### ✅ CLOSE — Resolved by in-flight work

| # | Issue | Closed by |
|---|-------|-----------|
| #271 | PR #297 (merge now) |
| #269 | PR #297 (merge now) |

### 📦 DEFER — v0.7.0 (not demo-critical)

| # | Issue | Why defer |
|---|-------|-----------|
| #272 | Live Azure pricing | Issue says "not a demo blocker." Estimated prices acceptable. |
| #277 | Session token/cost tracker | Issue says "not a blocker." Nice-to-have. |
| #46 | Multi-surface MCP | 3-4 week architecture epic. Wrong sprint for this. Stays on v0.6.0. |

## 4. Parallel Tracks (post BURN NOW completion)

| Track | Issues | Lead | Fry | Bender | Zapp |
|-------|--------|------|-----|--------|------|
| **A: Wizard Flow** | #275, then #301 | Review | Phase UI | Prompt + state machine | Review #301 |
| **B: GitHub** | #274 (finishing) | — | A2UI components | OAuth service | Review before merge |
| **C: Azure** | #301 | — | AuthCard, DeployProgress | MSAL, ARM API | Mandatory review |
| **D: Polish** | #265, #266, #273, #300, #296, #299 | — | #265, #273 | #266, #300 | — |

Hermes enters after Track A + B land for E2E test pass.

## 5. Sprint Capacity (T-shirt estimates)

| Agent | Burn Now | Burn Next | Blocked | Total |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Fry** | #298 (M), #299 (S), #274-frontend (L) | #275-frontend (L), #265 (M) | #301-frontend (L), #273 (L) | 3S + 3M + 3L |
| **Bender** | #274-backend (L) | #300 (S), #275-backend (L), #266 (M) | #301-backend (XL) | 1S + 1M + 3L + 1XL |
| **@copilot** | — | #296 (S) | — | 1S |
| **Hermes** | — | — | E2E test pass (M) | 1M |
| **Zapp** | — | — | #274 review (S), #301 review (M) | 1S + 1M |
| **Leela** | PR #297 approval | Architecture reviews | Final review | Reviews only |

**Fry is the bottleneck.** Almost every issue has frontend work. Mitigation: @copilot handles #296, #299 is a quick fix, #273 is back-loaded.

## 6. Next Wave for Ralph

**Once current agents report back (PR #297 merged, #298/#299 done, #274 in progress):**

```
Wave 1: #300 (Bender), #296 (@copilot), #275 (Bender+Fry), #265 (Fry), #266 (Bender)
         — all can start in parallel, no cross-dependencies
Wave 2: #274 finishes → #301 (Bender+Fry), #300 finishes → #273 (Fry)
         — blocked items unblock
Wave 3: Hermes E2E test, Zapp security review of #274 + #301
Wave 4: Leela final review → Bender release cut
```

**Ralph's immediate action list:**
1. Monitor PR #297 merge → auto-close #271, #269
2. Monitor #298, #299 completion → trigger Wave 1
3. Fire Wave 1 items as parallel lanes: #300, #296, #275, #265, #266
4. Monitor #274 completion → trigger #301
5. Monitor #300 completion → trigger #273
6. After Waves 1-2 complete → trigger Hermes + Zapp
