# Squad Retro Log

Workflow-owned record of every merged or closed PR. One line per entry. Rows are appended on PR close, and the workflow may later backfill `reverted=true` if a standard git revert lands on `main`. Do not hand-edit.

Format:
```
- YYYY-MM-DD | #NNN "title" | size | impl=XXm | review=XXm | cycles=N | outcome | author | first_review=XXm | ci=XXm | reviewer=bot|human|none | human_comments=N | issue=#NNN/none | estimate=S/M/L/XL/unknown | rejections_by_reviewer=nibbler:X,leela:Y,zapp:Z | reverted=true/false
```

Legend:
- **size** — S / M / L / XL based on lines changed (S ≤50, M ≤250, L ≤1000, XL >1000)
- **impl** — time from branch first-commit to PR opened
- **review** — time from PR ready-for-review to merge/close
- **cycles** — number of review-then-push loops
- **outcome** — `merged` / `closed` / `merged-with-rework`
- **author** — GitHub login
- **first_review** — time from PR open to the first submitted review (`n/a` when none)
- **ci** — total completed check-run duration for the PR head SHA (`n/a` when unavailable)
- **reviewer** — whether the first submitted reviewer was a `bot`, `human`, or `none`
- **human_comments** — human-authored review + issue comment count (bot comments excluded)
- **issue** — linked in-repo issue from the PR closing keyword (`Closes #NNN`), else `none`
- **estimate** — linked issue label `estimate:S|M|L|XL`, else `unknown`
- **rejections_by_reviewer** — count of `*:rejected` label applications during the PR lifecycle
- **reverted** — `true` once a later trusted `git revert` commit on `main` is associated back to the PR, else `false`

Historical rows before each schema extension keep their older trailing columns.
